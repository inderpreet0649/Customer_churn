## 🔍 Final Conclusion   

- **Key Insights**:     
  - 23.6% of senior citizens churned, higher than non-seniors (16.4%).   
  - Month-to-month contracts show 42.7% churn vs. 2.8% for two-year contracts.    
  - 14.6% churn without online security vs. 7.4% with it.    
- **Conclusion**: Churn is driven by short contracts, lack of additional services, and demographic factors like age.   
- **Suggestions**:     
  - Offer incentives for longer contracts. 🎉    
  - Promote services like online security. 🔒    
  - Tailor support for senior citizens. 👴
